# Rylix Is A Skid   
This repository contains a decompiled version of every one of Rylixmods' free "hacks". Mainly to expose him for hiding very malicious code inside of his programs.   

# Credits   
- Todd GD (thank you for helping decomp!)   
- CNSL (original decompiler and provider of the source code files)   
- Harm (uploading the repo while Todd GD is shadowbanned)
- Calloc (me, Forked Harm's repository and Reverse engineered the parts that the python decompilers couldn't quite get or do correctly, It took me quite a bit of time as well)
- RadzikanistraMod (Provided extra background information, Thank you for helping us!)


# To Rylix
You never worked with Anaban. Anaban has said numerous times he doesn't know you. Quit lying, you've been caught.   

# The Code Rylix Skidded & Copied
- [Discord Token Grabber V2 by AstraaDev](https://github.com/AstraaDev/Discord-Token-Grabber-V2/blob/main/token_grabber.py)

# PSA
Do not buy or use any of Rylix's "hacks", as they all contain the same malicious code & trojans. He is selling the other scripts for money to keep us out which only adds to his exposure and flushes his reputation down the toilet.
He claims he does this for "security" reasons, but anyone with an IQ over 4 knows it's complete bullshit.   
The code provided here is not clean and the previous developer had some very messy code. 
If you're planning on using anything here, clean it up first there's some __Very Malicious Code Inside!__
All have the same trojan, so it should be easy to clean.

# What Else Did People Like Us Do About It?
- Luckily ToddGD managed to spam and delete his Discord Webhook (Good Work ToddGD) and RadzikanistraMod did alot of digging around for info. This was done after I exposed the missing parts and extracted the webhook from the code so that he cannot go out ripping off more people.
 
- I (Calloc), am currently adding the final touches to the code and then checking to make sure that the entire decompilation does in fact match which I already have no doubt that it does.

- I also dumped one of his scripts that I did the full decompilation for into his server since you can still type in python code into discord without actually uploading files like so -> "```python" and then I dumped it in. Having the full version helps us know where he ripped the code and how the trojan behaves because from what I've discovered , It doesn't just grab one discord token, It can do multiple at a time.

- As of 8/10/2023 Me and RadzikanistraMod have been banned from his server and it seems to us that he enjoys censoring us, this is typical for anyone that wishes to weasel out of an argument.
- During that time It had encouraged me to finish up the decomp and now we just need to match the bytecodes up afterwards...
- I Have no doubt that I'm now 100% Done with the decomplation and I'll be trying to get people to come and see this fork
If needed I'll change the name of this repository. or ask if harm can forward people to my full crack of his code...
